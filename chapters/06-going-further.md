# Going further
There's a few things we can improve on that simple register/login process :
* Add a "Remember me" option
* Add permissions and roles
* Pimp your simple php with cool stuff
* Use a framework with built-in user management systems
* Use virtualisation

I won't go into detailed explanations, but we will at least overview what can be done. About the framework, I've used Symfony a lot, but only started recently Laravel, so I'll focus on the former.

You'll find all these information in the ``/going-further`` folder in this repository, have fun ;)
